Amazon Revenue Performance & Customer Behaviour Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon sales data to uncover key revenue drivers and understand customer purchasing behaviour.

The objective was to analyze revenue distribution across product categories and regions, evaluate the impact of pricing and discounts, and identify patterns influencing sales performance.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze revenue performance across product categories and regions

Identify key factors driving total revenue

Understand the impact of discount percentage on sales quantity

Study customer behaviour using rating and review data

Examine monthly revenue trends

🔍 Key Insights

Revenue is evenly distributed across product categories and regions, indicating diversified business performance.

Strong positive correlation (0.71) between price and total revenue.

Moderate positive correlation (0.59) between quantity sold and revenue.

Discount percentage shows weak impact on quantity sold.

Revenue distribution is positively skewed — a small number of high-value transactions contribute significantly.

Monthly revenue fluctuates, suggesting possible seasonal demand patterns.

Review count does not strongly influence revenue generation.

💡 Business Conclusions

Pricing strategy plays a more critical role in revenue generation than aggressive discounting.

The business demonstrates geographic and product diversification, reducing dependency risk.

A small segment of high-value transactions drives a large portion of total revenue.

Customer purchasing behaviour appears less sensitive to discounts and review volume.
